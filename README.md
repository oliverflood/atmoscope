# ☁️ Atmoscope ☁️
An ML project focused on multi-label cloud type identification primarily from the [NASA GLOBE CLOUD GAZE dataset](https://observer.globe.gov/get-data/clouds-data#cloudgaze). 
Built with PyTorch, torchvision backbones, multi-label metrics, and MLflow tracking. 

**Still in progress!** More experiments and better models coming soon :)

## Deployment
Check out the current [deployment on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/oliverflood/Atmoscope_v1). 

## More Info
Take a look at this [blog post](https://oliverflood.com/posts/clouds_1/) on my website, which documents part of the process so far. 

## Extra Info
Special emphasis is placed on object oriented design principles. I took inspiration from [Beyond Jupyter](https://github.com/aai-institute/beyond-jupyter). 
For the data, I also explored using the [CCSN dataset on Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CADDPD) and the plain [NASA GLOBE data](https://observer.globe.gov/get-data#data).
